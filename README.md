## tkinter intro

[Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.

It allows to make buttons and other GUI controls in Python.

Professionals use Tkinter for simple applications, internal tools, and quick prototypes due to simplicity and because it is included with Python
standard library.

For complex or visually appealing applications, professionals often choose other GUI libraries like PyQt or wxPython, or web frameworks like Django or Flask.

## The steps to learn tkinter

### `Hello world`

#### `Hello world` in a replit

[Replit](https://replit.com/) is an online integrated development environment (IDE) that allows users to write code in various programming languages **directly in the web browser.** It supports a multitude of programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, HTML/CSS, and many more.

❗ Please, make sure you have your own [replit](https://replit.com) account for the seminars.

❗ To start a new tkinter project in replit choose the tkinter template.

Aa good first step is to build a simple Hello World application.

[Here](https://replit.com/@missPunter/intro-tkinter-ifcs2#main.py) is one you can fork and experiment with.

##### 🍴 Please, fork

❗ You need to fork  my app to edit it but during the seminar I will give you access to edit my code.

Things to do: change the background colour, font size, add another line of text, some emojis in different parts of the text.
