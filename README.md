## tkinter intro

[Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.

It allows to make buttons and other GUI controls in Python.


Professionals use Tkinter for simple applications, internal tools, and quick prototypes due to simplicity and because it is included with Python
standard library.

For complex or visually appealing applications, professionals often choose other GUI libraries like PyQt or wxPython, or web frameworks like Django or Flask.
